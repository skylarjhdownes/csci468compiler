<h1>Design Tradeoffs</h1>

<h2>Data Structure Tradeoffs</h2>

<h3>Symbol Table Design</h3>
<p>
Our implementation of the symbol table as a singularly linked list forced our lookup of elements in the table to be O(n).  It was determined that this was the simplest solution for all of us to create at the time that would sufficiently complete the task, and thus creating a more complex and efficient solution was far beyond the point of diminishing returns.
</p>
<h3>Semantic Analyzer Design</h3>
<p>The semantic analyzer simply was a static class that simply did what is was told with whatever information it was given or already had at it’s disposal. It’s design took readability over superb efficiency, since this was essentially a demonstration of our understanding of the concepts. In order to express our understanding as clearly as possible, we took readability over efficiency when we programmed the semantic analyzer.<br><br>When it came to the code generation of the semantic analyzer, we took liberal use of the stack. Since variables could be either referenced in the called function, or just pass their values, both their address and value were put on the stack, and the function would decide which was needed when it created it’s activation record and started grabbing input parameters. There are more efficient ways to use the stack in this case however, readability and major design choices would have been affected greatly, so it was decided that we take liberal use of the stack rather than have the shortcomings represent themselves in the code for the compiler.
